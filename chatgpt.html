            <p><span>BAPS Swaminarayan Akshardham</span> in Robbinsville, New Jersey is a large Hindu mandir (temple) built
                between 2015 and 2023 by the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha, which venerates Swaminarayan (1781–1830) as the highest
                manifestation of Purushottama (Vishnu). It is by a significant margin the largest Hindu mandir in the
                Western Hemisphere, and the third-largest in the world. The Akshardham temple in Robbinsville is evolving as
                the global mecca for Hindu pilgrimage.</p>
            <p>The central shrine is dedicated to its founders Swaminarayan and Gunatitanand Swami, worshiped together as
                Akshar Purushottam Maharaj (supreme God). The Akshardham was initiated by BAPS's fifth spiritual leader,
                Pramukh Swami Maharaj, and is one of the three Akshardham mandirs constructed by the BAPS Swaminarayan
                Sanstha; the other two are in New Delhi and Gandhinagar in India.</p>
            <p>The Akshardham campus also contains the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir (Robbinsville, New Jersey), a smaller
                traditional shikharbaddha mandir built between 2010 and 2014; and further Nilkanth Plaza, a welcome center,
                a vegetarian cafe, the BAPS Swaminarayan Research Institute, a museum, and an event center.</p>

            <p>BAPS Hindu Mandir Abu Dhabi is a traditional Hindu temple built by the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha in Abu
                Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE). Inspired by Pramukh Swami Maharaj (1921–2016) and consecrated by Mahant
                Swami Maharaj on 14 February 2024, this is the first traditional Hindu mandir in Abu Dhabi.</p>
            <p>In August 2015, the UAE government announced they would provide the land for the mandir. Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan,
                the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, gifted 27 acres of land for the mandir. In December 2019, the construction commenced.</p>
            <p>The mandir is constructed from pink sandstone from northern Rajasthan and marble from Italy. It stands
                108 feet tall, 262 feet in length and 180 feet in width. This is the first Hindu stone mandir to undergo
                complete digital modeling and seismic simulations during construction.</p>
